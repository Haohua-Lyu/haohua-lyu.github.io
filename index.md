## Project

* **[WebTransceiVR](https://www.behance.net/gallery/133237183/WebTransceiVR-Asymmetric-VR-Collaboration-At-Scale) supervised by Prof. Bjoern Hartmann (Ongoing)**
  - **Paper (co-first author) published on CHI 2022 Late-breaking work!** View on [ACM Library](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519816).
  - Researched online asymmetric communication between VR users and multiple non-VR users;
  - Designed and developed a WebRTC-based network infrastructure to allow multiple non-VR users to join and interact with a VR virtual environment, and a cloud-based streaming solution to accommodate a large amount of spectators.
  - Working on advance camera control and new interactivity for a new iteration.

* **[Vision Correcting Display](https://barskygroup.wixsite.com/home) supervised by Prof. Brian Barsky (Ongoing)** - Algorithm Parallelization
  
  - Refactored and accelerated algorithms using OpenCV, OpenMP, OpenCL, and Intel oneAPI, with 3x-20x faster performance.

* **Research on the Stagnation of Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)**

  - Researched various causes of the recent stagnation of the TPP, developed an analysis to evaluate the effects of national,
organizational, and regional factors on the treaty, and anticipated future possibilities;
  - Wrote a research article and published on [China-US Focus](https://www.chinausfocus.com/finance-economy/why-the-tpp-collapsed).
